# LightsOS 💡

**LightsOS** is a conceptual Operating System simulator written in pure Python. 

It replicates the core architecture of a real OS, featuring a micro-kernel, a round-robin process scheduler, and a virtual JSON-based file system. It demonstrates how processes, system calls, and I/O management work under the hood.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Kernel Architecture:** Implements a generator-based process scheduler.
*   **Virtual Filesystem:** Uses `data/disk.json` to simulate a persistent disk drive.
*   **Shell Interface:** A working CLI with command parsing and state management.
*   **I/O Redirection:** Supports the pipe operator (`|`) to send output from one command to a file.
*   **Implemented Commands:**
    *   `ls`: List directory contents (supports absolute & relative paths).
    *   `cd`: Change directory with state tracking.
    *   `cat`: Read file contents.
    *   `echo`: Print text (or write to file via pipe).
    *   `ps`: View active kernel process stats.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LightsOS.git
    cd LightsOS
    ```

2.  **Run the OS:**
    LightsOS requires no external libraries. Run it directly using Python's module flag:
    ```bash
    python -m core.kernel
    ```

## 📂 Architecture

The project is structured to mimic real OS components:

├── data/
│   └── disk.json       # The "Hard Drive" storage
└── README.md

🧠 How it Works

    Boot: The Kernel initializes and loads disk.json into memory.

    Scheduling: The Kernel runs an infinite loop. It picks a process from the process_queue, runs it until it yields (StopIteration or IO Request), and then places it back in the queue.

    The Shell: The Shell is just a process! It runs in an infinite loop yielding control back to the Kernel after every command.

📝 Future Roadmap

Implement mkdir and touch commands.

Add a user permission system (Root vs Guest).

    Implement a shutdown command to save the JSON state back to the disk file.
